# CalgaryHacks_Ice_Hockey_Game

## **Inspiration**
Canada's sport: Ice Hockey!

## **What it does**
Just a friendly mini-game of ice-hockey

## **How we built it**
Built from scratch using the Scratch programming language

## **Challenges we ran into**
Learnt scratch for this and then figuring out how to host the game onto a web app

## **Accomplishments that we're proud of**
A functional game!

## **What we learned**
Using Scratch to build a game

## **What's next for The Canadian Mini-Game: Ice-Hockey!**
A scoreboard, keeping track of score rather than just the friendly scrimmage! We should patch some of the bugs as well
